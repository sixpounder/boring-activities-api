# Boring Activities

A boring activities rest API implemnentation.

## Why?

I use it for interview problems and questions. You can too, if you need it.

## Setup

- `git clone https://github.com/sixpounder/boring-activities-api.git`
- `cd boring-activities-api`
- `deno install`
- `deno task dev` for local development, `deno task build` for a production
  build of the SPA

## Endpoints

At `http://<hostname>` you will get a graphical UI that describes the endpoint
and can be used to call them. The api itself is located at
`http://<hostname/api`.
